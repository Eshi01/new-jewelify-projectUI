Is your jewelry store website ADA compliant?
<br></br>
ADA compliance. Have you heard of it? If not, you definitely will. Today. I'm going to be talking to you about a solution to make your website ADA compliant.\
<br></br>
Back in 2018, the department of justice affirmed that websites needed to be accessible.
<br></br>
Now you might be asking what is web accessibility?
<br></br>
Well, let's take a look, web disability as a set of rules, behaviors, code standards, and design guidelines that are meant to allow people with disabilities to effectively use websites. That's where ADA compliance comes from. Website accessibility focuses on these main areas, blindness, motor and mobility, colorblindness epilepsy, blurred vision, cognitive disorders, cataracts, and more.
<br></br>
The truth is your website should be ADA compliant, not just because we want to help people with disabilities.
<br></br>
We definitely do and that's the most important reason, but also because lawsuits have gone up to 200% in the last year, which is kind of crazy. In fact, we've gotten so many clients asking us, what do we do about this? How do we solve it? And we were scrambling to figure out the best. Now we have the solution and we're super excited to tell you a little bit about it.
We've partnered up with a company called Userway.
<br></br>
Up until now. The problem has been making your website ADA compliant. It's a very complicated task. It takes a lot of time and a lot of money. But now using Userway, an AI powered solution, an interface that makes your website compliant within 48 hours.
<br></br>
Let me show you how it works. Userway, utilizes two components that work together to achieve compliance. The first is the foreground application, which is responsible for 30% of the requirements. What you see here on the screen in this wheelchair icon that's Userway. Once that's clicked, it opens up a simple but extensive interface that helps people with disabilities.
<br></br>
For instance, you can easily adjust the font size on the website. You can see over on the screen, that it's adjusting the website with the font size that is needed. Another example is you can invert the colors of the website, which helps people with visual impairment. It goes on and on, but the point is that it makes it simple, super quickly to adjust what is needed to adjust on the website in a very friendly and seamless way.
<br></br>
The second part of Userway is a background application, which is an AI machine learning. It's responsible for 70% of the requirements, mostly related to blind people, screen reader, adjustments, and keyboard navigation.
<br></br>
After Userway is installed on your website. It takes about 48 hours for the AI to make sure that your entire website is fully compliant.
<br></br>
At the end, you receive an accessibility statement that's automatically posted on your site. But one of the coolest things that user weight has is that every 24 hours, the AI goes back to the site and scans it to see if there are any new content and makes that content also compliant. So, not only is it a one-time solution, it's an ongoing solution that continues to make sure that your website is up to date and running how it is meant to be. Compliant.
<br></br>
